# React Native Simple Integer Calculator

Uses the React Native, RN Paper, and Expo packages 

###Problem
Build a simple four function (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division) calculator.

*Note: there is no mention of floating points, sign inversion, percentages,
having the functionality work exactly like IOS calculator, or having a 
clear button versus an all clear button.

###Accomplishments
1) IOS UX calculator mock - appearance
2) Simple arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, divide
3) Integer - add, subtract, multiply, and divide 
4) Dynamic layout - scales based on available width
5) Implements an error when the number goes beyond the screen width
6) Has styling constants separated out into own directory

###TODOs with more time: making it more like the actual IOS calculator
1) scaling the text size down as the number grows
2) AC and clear buttons
3) floating point arithmetic
4) other minor UX details (0 adjusted to left to work with dynamic sizes)
5) Adding tests: unit and functional
6) code comments to add to the descriptive naming and intuitive functionality
7) fix the arithmetic buttons to not preform the operation on click

##Running the code (tested using web and android)
> npm install && 
> npm run android
